Behavior
~~~~~~~~

Behavior of an instance is mostly defined by the instance process functions, these are defined to the process function of the object type at birth.

Messaging
~~~~~~~~~

Game code or events can post or query instances using generic functions, this allows you to query an instance without having to call some object type specific function, the game will call the right message or query function.

[source,cpp]
----
Instance* lever = // some instance with object type SWITCH

if (
	INSTANCE_Query(lever, 233) == 1) // will call SWITCH_Query which will handle query 233 and return the switch status
{
	// switch down
}
